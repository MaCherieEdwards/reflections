When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository if I were collaborating on a project with others, and wanted them to be able to contribute to my project.
It would also be best to use a remote repo if I wanted to allow others to use part of all of my code to create projects of their own.
Lastly, if you wanted to publicly share your work, a (public) remote repo would allow you to do that easily.
